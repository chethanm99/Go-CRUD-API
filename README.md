# Go-CRUD-API

This is a CRUD API that is used to perform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a web server which is
used to get the information about movies web-server.

**This includes the following handlers:**

1. "/movies" - used to get the list of all the available movies.
2. "/movies/{id}" - used to get the specific movie by its ID number.

**On fetching the details of the movie, you will get the following contents about the movie:**

1. The Identification Number (ID) of the movie.
2. The ISBN is a unique number assigned to every movie.
3. The Title of the movie.
4. The First name and the Last name of the director.
